It helps in understanding and designing a network communication system that is interoperable and modular.</p> <p>Think of it like a delivery system for data, with each layer performing a specific role, just like departments in a postal service.</p> <p>Each layer of the OSI model is responsible for a distinct part of the communication process. Together, they break down complex network interactions into manageable parts.</p>"},{"location":"Blogs/blog9/#the-7-layers-of-the-osi-model-from-top-to-bottom","title":"\ud83d\udcc3 The 7 Layers of the OSI Model (From Top to Bottom)","text":""},{"location":"Blogs/blog9/#7-application-layer","title":"7.
