In this lab, you learn about users and groups. Users and groups are the basic building blocks for an identity solution. This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using East US . Estimated Timing: 30 Minutes Lab Scenario Adamantus Technologies is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services. A few engineers are being hired to manage the lab environment, including the virtual machines. To allow the engineers to authenticate by using Microsoft Entra ID , you have been tasked with provisioning users and groups. To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles. Architecture Diagram Job Skills Task 1: Create and configure user accounts. Task 2: Create groups and add members. Task 1: Create and Configure User Accounts In this task, you will create and configure user accounts. User accounts will store user data such as name, department, location, and contact information. Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com . To proceed to the portal, select Cancel on the Welcome to Azure splash screen. Note: The Azure portal is used in all the labs. If you are new to the Azure, search for and select Quickstart Center . Take a few minutes to watch the Getting started in the Azure portal video. Even if you have used the portal before, you will find a few tips and tricks on navigating and customizing the interface. Search for and select Microsoft Entra ID . Microsoft Entra ID is Azure's cloud-based identity and access management solution. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with some of the features listed in the left pane. Select the Overview blade and then the Manage tenants tab. Did you know? A tenant is a specific instance of Microsoft Entra ID containing accounts and groups. Depending on your situation, you can create more tenants and Switch between them. Return to the Entra ID page by pressing back in the browser or selecting the option in the breadcrumb menu. As you have time, explore other options such as Licenses and Password reset . Create a New User Select Users , then in the New user drop-down select Create new user . Create a new user with the following settings (leave others with their defaults). On the Properties tab notice all the different types of information that can be included in the user account. Setting Value User principal name az104-user1 Display name az104-user1 Auto-generate password checked Account enabled checked Job title (Properties tab) IT Lab Administrator Department (Properties tab) IT Usage location (Properties tab) United States Once you have finished reviewing, select Review + create and then Create . Refresh the page and confirm your new user was created. Invite an External User In the New user drop-down select Invite an external user . Setting Value Email your email address Display name your name Send invite message check the box Message Welcome to Azure and our group project Move to the Properties tab. Complete the basic information, including these fields. Setting Value Job title IT Lab Administrator Department IT Usage location (Properties tab) United States Select Review + invite , and then Invite . Refresh the page and confirm the invited user was created. You should receive the invitation email shortly. Note: It is unlikely you will be creating user accounts individually. Do you know how your organization plans to create and manage user accounts? Task 2: Create Groups and Add Members In this task, you create a group account. Group accounts can include user accounts or devices. These are two basic ways members are assigned to groups: Statically and Dynamically. Static groups require administrators to add and remove members manually. Dynamic groups update automatically based on the properties of a user account or device. For example, job title. In the Azure portal, search for and select Microsoft Entra ID . In the Manage blade, select Groups . Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the group settings in the left pane. Expiration lets you configure a group lifetime in days. After that time the group must be renewed by the owner. Naming policy lets you configure blocked words and add a prefix or suffix to group names. In the All groups blade, select + New group and create a new group. Setting Value Group type Security Group name IT Lab Administrators Group description Administrators that manage the IT lab Membership type Assigned Note : An Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license is required for dynamic membership. If other Membership types are available, the options will show up in the drop-down. Select No owners selected . In the Add owners page, search for and select yourself (shown in the top right corner) as the owner. Notice you can have more than one owner. Select No members selected . In the Add members pane, search for and select the az104-user1 and the guest user you invited. Add both of the users to the group. Select Create to deploy the group. Refresh the page and ensure your group was created. Select the new group and review the Members and Owners information. Note: You may be managing a large number of groups. Does your organization have a plan for creating groups and adding members? Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are some main takeways for this lab: A tenant represents your organization and helps you to manage a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for your internal and external users. Microsoft Entra ID has user and guest accounts. Each account has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done. Groups combine together related users or devices. There are two types of groups including Security and Microsoft 365. Group membership can be statically or dynamically assigned.

All rights reserved.| Developed by Deepak Kumar Tyagi","title":"Key Takeaways"},{"location":"LAB_02a_Manage_Subscriptions_and_RBAC_Entra/","text":"Lab - Manage Subscriptions and RBAC Lab Introduction In this lab, you learn about role-based access control. You learn how to use permissions and scopes to control what actions identities can and cannot perform. You also learn how to make subscription management easier using management groups. This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using East US . Estimated Timing: 30 Minutes Lab Scenario To simplify management of Azure resources in your organization, you have been tasked with implementing the following functionality: Creating a management group that includes all your Azure subscriptions. Granting permissions to submit support requests for all subscriptions in the management group. The permissions should be limited only to: Create and manage virtual machines Create support request tickets (do not include adding Azure providers) Interactive Lab Simulations There are some interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required. Manage access with RBAC . Assign built-in role to a user and monitor the activity logs. Manage subscriptions and RBAC . Implement a management group and create and assign a custom RBAC role. Open a support request . Review support plan options, then create and monitor a support request, technical or billing. Architecture Diagram Job Skills Task 1: Implement management groups. Task 2: Review and assign a built-in Azure role. Task 3: Create a custom RBAC role. Task 4: Monitor role assignments with the Activity Log. Task 1: Implement Management Groups In this task, you will create and configure management groups. Management groups are used to logically organize and segment subscriptions. They allow for RBAC and Azure Policy to be assigned and inherited to other management groups and subscriptions. For example, if your organization has a dedicated support team for Europe, you can organize European subscriptions into a management group to provide the support staff access to those subscriptions (without providing individual access to all subscriptions). In our scenario everyone at the Help Desk will need to create a support request across all subscriptions. Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com . Search for and select Microsoft Entra ID . In the Manage blade, select Properties . Review the Access management for Azure resources area. Ensure you can manage access to all Azure subscriptions and management groups in the tenant. Search for and select Management groups . On the Management groups blade, click + Create . Create a management group with the following settings. Select Submit when you are done. Setting Value Management group ID az104-mg1 (must be unique in the directory) Management group display name az104-mg1 Refresh the management group page to ensure your new management group displays. This may take a minute. Note: Did you notice the root management group? The root management group is built into the hierarchy to have all management groups and subscriptions fold up to it. This root management group allows for global policies and Azure role assignments to be applied at the directory level. After creating a management group, you would add any subscriptions that should be included in the group. Task 2: Review and Assign a Built-in Azure Role In this task, you will review the built-in roles and assign the VM Contributor role to a member of the Help Desk. Azure provides a large number of built-in roles. Select the az104-mg1 management group. Select the Access control (IAM) blade, and then the Roles tab. Scroll through the built-in role definitions that are available. View a role to get detailed information about the Permissions , JSON , and Assignments . You will often use owner , contributor , and reader . Select + Add , from the drop-down menu, select Add role assignment . On the Add role assignment blade, search for and select the Virtual Machine Contributor . The Virtual machine contributor role lets you manage virtual machines, but not access their operating system or manage the virtual network and storage account they are connected to. This is a good role for the Help Desk. Select Next . Did you know? Azure originally provided only the Classic deployment model. This has been replaced by the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. As a best practice, do not use classic resources. On the Members tab, Select Members . Note: The next step assigns the role to the helpdesk group. If you do not have a Help Desk group, take a minute to create it. Search for and select the helpdesk group. Click Select . Click Review + assign twice to create the role assignment. Continue on the Access control (IAM) blade. On the Role assignments tab, confirm the helpdesk group has the Virtual Machine Contributor role. Note: As a best practice always assign roles to groups not individuals. Did you know? This assignment might not actually grant you any additional privileges. If you already have the Owner role, that role includes all permissions associated with the VM Contributor role. Task 3: Create a Custom RBAC Role In this task, you will create a custom RBAC role. Custom roles are a core part of implementing the principle of least privilege for an environment. Built-in roles might have too many permissions for your scenario. We will also create a new role and remove permissions that are not necessary. Do you have a plan for managing overlapping permissions? Continue working on your management group. Navigate to the Access control (IAM) blade. Select + Add , from the drop-down menu, select Add custom role . On the Basics tab complete the configuration. Setting Value Custom role name Custom Support Request Description A custom contributor role for support requests. For Baseline permissions , select Clone a role . In the Role to clone drop-down menu, select Support Request Contributor . Select Next to move to the Permissions tab, and then select + Exclude permissions . In the resource provider search field, enter .Support and select Microsoft.Support . In the list of permissions, place a checkbox next to Other: Registers Support Resource Provider and then select Add . The role should be updated to include this permission as a NotAction . Note: An Azure resource provider is a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service. We do not want the Help Desk to be able to have this capability, so it is being removed from the cloned role. On the Assignable scopes tab, ensure your management group is listed, then click Next . Review the JSON for the Actions , NotActions , and AssignableScopes that are customized in the role. Select Review + Create , and then select Create . Note: At this point, you have created a custom role and assigned it to the management group. Task 4: Monitor Role Assignments with the Activity Log In this task, you view the activity log to determine if anyone has created a new role. In the portal locate the az104-mg1 resource and select Activity log . The activity log provides insight into subscription-level events. Review the activites for role assignments. The activity log can be filtered for specific operations. Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. Management groups are used to logically organize subscriptions. The built-in root management group includes all the management groups and subscriptions. Azure has many built-in roles. You can assign these roles to control access to resources. You can create new roles or customize existing roles. Roles are defined in a JSON formatted file and include Actions , NotActions , and AssignableScopes . You can use the Activity Log to monitor role assignments.

You learn how Azure policies can ensure operational decisions are enforced across the organization. You learn how to use resource tagging to improve reporting. This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using East US . Estimated Timing: 30 Minutes Lab Scenario Adamantus Technologies cloud footprint has grown considerably in the last year. During a recent audit, you discovered a substantial number of resources that do not have a defined owner, project, or cost center. In order to improve management of Azure resources in your organization, you decide to implement the following functionality: Apply resource tags to attach important metadata to Azure resources Enforce the use of resource tags for new resources by using Azure policy Update existing resources with resource tags Use resource locks to protect configured resources Interactive Lab Simulations There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required. Manage resource locks . Add a resource lock and test to confirm. Create an Azure policy . Create an Azure policy that restricts the location resources can be located. Create a new resource and ensure the policy is enforced. Manage governance via Azure policy . Create and assign tags via the Azure portal. Create an Azure policy that requires tagging. Remediate non-compliant resources. Architecture Diagram Job Skills Task 1: Create and assign tags via the Azure portal. Task 2: Enforce tagging via an Azure Policy. Task 3: Apply tagging via an Azure Policy. Task 4: Configure and test resource locks. Task 1: Assign Tags via the Azure Portal In this task, you will create and assign a tag to an Azure resource group via the Azure portal. Tags are a critical component of a governance strategy as outlined by the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework and Cloud Adoption Framework. Tags can allow you to quickly identify resource owners, sunset dates, group contacts, and other name/value pairs that your organization deems important. For this task, you assign a tag identifying the resource role ('Infra' for 'Infrastructure'). Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com . Search for and select Resource groups . From the Resource groups, select + Create . Setting Value Subscription name your subscription Resource group name az104-rg2 Location East US Note: For each lab in this course you will create a new resource group. This lets you quickly locate and manage your lab resources. Select Next and move to the Tags tab. Provide information for a new tag. Setting Value Name Cost Center Value 000 Select Review + Create , and then select Create . Task 2: Enforce Tagging via an Azure Policy In this task, you will assign the built-in Require a tag and its value on resources policy to the resource group and evaluate the outcome. Azure Policy can be used to enforce configuration, and in this case, governance, to your Azure resources. In the Azure portal, search for and select Policy . In the Authoring blade, select Definitions . Take a moment to browse through the list of built-in policy definitions that are available for you to use. Notice you can also search for a definition. Search for the Require a tag and its value on resources built-in policy. Select the policy and take a minute to review the definition. Select Assign policy . Specify the Scope by clicking the ellipsis button and selecting the following values. Click Select when you are done. Setting Value Subscription your subscription Resource Group az104-rg2 Note : You can assign policies on the management group, subscription, or resource group level. You also have the option of specifying exclusions, such as individual subscriptions, resource groups, or resources. In this scenario, we want the tag on all the resources in the resource group. Configure the Basics properties of the assignment by specifying the following settings (leave others with their defaults): Setting Value Assignment name `Require Cost Center tag and its value on resources Description Require Cost Center tag and its value on all resources in the resource group Policy enforcement Enabled Note : The Assignment name is automatically populated with the policy name you selected, but you can change it. The Description is optional. Notice you can disable the policy at any time. Click Next and set Parameters to the following values: Setting Value Tag Name Cost Center Tag Value 000 Click Next and review the Remediation tab. Leave the Create a Managed Identity checkbox unchecked. Click Review + Create and then click Create . Note : Now you will verify that the new policy assignment is in effect by attempting to create an Azure Storage account in the resource group. You will create the storage account without adding the required tag. Note : It might take between 5 and 10 minutes for the policy to take effect. In the portal, search for and select Storage Accounts , and select + Create . On the Basics tab of the Create storage account blade, complete the configuration. Setting Value Resource group az104-rg2 Storage account name any globally unique combination of between 3 and 24 lower case letters and digits, starting with a letter Select Review and then click Create . You should receive a Validation failed message. View the message to identify the reason for the failure. Verify the error message states that the resource deployment was disallowed by the policy. Note : By clicking the Raw Error tab, you can find more details about the error, including the name of the role definition Require a tag and its value on resources . The deployment failed because the storage account you attempted to create did not have a tag named Cost Center with its value set to Default . Task 3: Apply Tagging via an Azure policy In this task, we will use the new policy definition to remediate any non-compliant resources. In this scenario, we will make any child resources of a resource group inherit the Cost Center tag that was defined on the resource group. In the Azure portal, search for and select Policy . In the Authoring section, click Assignments . In the list of assignments, click the ellipsis icon in the row representing the Require a tag and its value on resources policy assignment and use the Delete assignment menu item to delete the assignment. Click Assign policy and specify the Scope by clicking the ellipsis button and selecting the following values: Setting Value Subscription your Azure subscription Resource Group az104-rg2 To specify the Policy definition , click the ellipsis button and then search for and select Inherit a tag from the resource group if missing . Select Add and then configure the remaining Basics properties of the assignment. Setting Value Assignment name Inherit the Cost Center tag and its value 000 from the resource group if missing Description Inherit the Cost Center tag and its value 000 from the resource group if missing Policy enforcement Enabled Click Next twice and set Parameters to the following values: Setting Value Tag Name Cost Center Click Next and, on the Remediation tab, configure the following settings (leave others with their defaults): Setting Value Create a remediation task enabled Policy to remediate Inherit a tag from the resource group if missing Note : This policy definition includes the Modify effect. So, a managed identity is required. Click Review + Create and then click Create . Note : To verify that the new policy assignment is in effect, you will create another Azure storage account in the same resource group without explicitly adding the required tag. Note : It might take between 5 and 10 minutes for the policy to take effect. Search for and select Storage Account and click + Create . On the Basics tab of the Create storage account blade, verify that you are using the Resource Group that the Policy was applied to and specify the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and click Review : Setting Value Storage account name any globally unique combination of between 3 and 24 lower case letters and digits, starting with a letter Verify that this time the validation passed and click Create . Once the new storage account is provisioned, click Go to resource . On the Tags blade, note that the tag Cost Center with the value 000 has been automatically assigned to the resource. Did you know? If you search for and select Tags in the portal, you can view the resources with a specific tag. Task 4: Configure and Test Resource Locks In this task, you configure and test a resource lock. Locks prevent either deletions or modifications of a resource. Search for and select your resource group. In the Settings blade, select Locks . Select Add and complete the resource lock information. When finished select Ok . Setting Value Lock name rg-lock Lock type delete (notice the selection for read-only) Navigate to the resource group Overview blade, and select Delete resource group . In the Enter resource group name to confirm deletion textbox provide the resource group name, az104-rg2 . Notice you can copy and paste the resource group name. Notice the warning: Deleting this resource group and its dependent resources is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Select Delete . You should receive a notification denying the deletion. Note: You will need to remove the lock if you intend to delete the resource group. Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. Azure tags are metadata that consists of a key-value pair. Tags describe a particular resource in your environment. In particular, tagging in Azure enables you to label your resources in a logical manner. Azure Policy establishes conventions for resources. Policy definitions describe resource compliance conditions and the effect to take if a condition is met. A condition compares a resource property field or a value to a required value. There are many built-in policy definitions and you can customize the policies. The Azure Policy remediation task feature is used to bring resources into compliance based on a definition and assignment. Resources that are non-compliant to a modify or deployIfNotExist definition assignment, can be brought into compliance using a remediation task. You can configure a resource lock on a subscription, resource group, or resource. The lock can protect a resource from accidental user deletions and modifications. The lock overrides any user permissions. Azure Policy is pre-deployment security practice. RBAC and resource locks are post-deployment security practice.

Estimated Timing: 50 Minutes Interactive Lab Simulations There are interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required. Manage Azure resources by using Azure Resource Manager templates . Review, create, and deploy a managed disks with a template. Create a virtual machine with a template . Deploy a virtual machine with a QuickStart template. Lab Scenario Your team wants to look at ways to automate and simplify resource deployments. Your organization is looking for ways to reduce administrative overhead, reduce human error and increase consistency. Architecture Diagram Job Skills Task 1: Create an Azure Resource Manager template. Task 2: Edit an Azure Resource Manager template and redeploy the template. Task 3: Configure the Cloud Shell and deploy a template with Azure PowerShell. Task 4: Deploy a template with the CLI. Task 5: Deploy a resource by using Azure Bicep. Task 1: Create an Azure Resource Manager Template In this task, we will create a managed disk in the Azure portal. Managed disks are storage designed to be used with virtual machines. Once the disk is deployed you will export a template that you can use in other deployments. Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com . Search for and select Disks . On the Disks page, select Create . On the Create a managed disk page, configure the disk and then select Ok . Setting Value Subscription your subscription Resource Group az104-rg3 (If necessary, select Create new .) Disk name az104-disk1 Region East US Availability zone No infrastructure redundancy required Source type None Performance Standard HDD (change size) Size 32 Gib Note: We are creating a simple managed disk so you can practice with templates. Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure. Click Review + Create then select Create . Monitor the notifications (upper right) and after the deployment select Go to resource . In the Automation blade, select Export template . Take a minute to review the Template and Parameters files. Click Download and save the templates to the local drive. This creates a compressed zipped file. Use File Explorer to extract the content of the downloaded file into the Downloads folder on your computer. Notice there are two JSON files (template and parameters). Did you know? You can export an entire resource group or just specific resources within that resource group. Task 2: Edit an Azure Resource Manager template and then redeploy the template In this task, you use the downloaded template to deploy a new managed disk. This task outlines how to quicky and easily repeat deployments. In the Azure portal, search for and select Deploy a custom template . On the Custom deployment blade, notice there is the ability to use a Quickstart template . There are many built-in templates as shown in the drop-down menu. Instead of using a Quickstart, select Build your own template in the editor . On the Edit template blade, click Load file and upload the template.json file you downloaded to the local disk. Within the editor pane, make these changes. Change disks_az104_disk1_name to disk_name (two places to change) Change az104-disk1 to az104-disk2 (one place to change) Notice this is a Standard disk. The location is eastus . The disk size is 32GB . Save your changes. Don't forget the parameters file. Select Edit parameters , click Load file and upload the parameters.json . Make this change so it matches the template file. Change disks_az104_disk1_name to disk_name (one place to change) Save your changes. Complete the custom deployment settings: Setting Value Subscription your subscription Resource Group az104-rg3 Region (US) East US) Disk_name az104-disk2 Select Review + Create and then select Create . Select Go to resource . Verify az104-disk2 was created. On the Overview blade, select the resource group, az104-rg3 . You should now have two disks. In the Settings section, click Deployments . Note: All deployments details are documented in the resource group. It is a good practice to review the first few template-based deployments to ensure success prior to using the templates for large-scale operations. Select a deployment and review the content of the Input and Template blades. Task 3: Configure the Cloud Shell and Deploy a Template with PowerShell In this task, you work with the Azure Cloud Shell and Azure PowerShell. Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible terminal for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell. In this task, you use PowerShell to deploy a template. Select the Cloud Shell icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. Alternately, you can navigate directly to https://shell.azure.com . When prompted to select either Bash or PowerShell , select PowerShell . Did you know? If you mostly work with Linux systems, Bash (CLI) feels more familiar. If you mostly work with Windows systems, Azure PowerShell feels more familiar. On the Getting started screen select Mount storage account , select your Storage account subscription , and then select Apply . Select I want to create a storage account and then Next . Complete the Create storage account information. Settings Values Resource Group az104-rg3 Region select your region Storage account (Create new) must be globally unique, between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower case letters only File share (Create new) fs-cloudshell When completed select Create . It will take a couple of minutes to provision the storage. Select Settings (top bar) and then Go to classic version . Select the Upload/Download files icon (top bar) and then select Upload . Upload both the template and parameters files from the Downloads directory. Select the Editor (curly brackets) icon and navigate to the template JSON file on the left in the navigation pane. Make a change. For example, change the disk name to az104-disk3 . Use Ctrl +S to save your changes. Note : You can target your template deployment to a resource group, subscription, management group, or tenant. Depending on the scope of the deployment, you use different commands. To deploy to a resource group, use New-AzResourceGroupDeployment . powershell New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName az104-rg3 -TemplateFile template.json -TemplateParameterFile parameters.json 1. Ensure the command completes and the ProvisioningState is Succeeded . Confirm the disk was created. powershell Get-AzDisk Task 4: Deploy a Template with the CLI Continue in the Cloud Shell select Bash . Confirm your choice. Verify your files are available in the Cloud Shell storage. If you completed the previous task your template files should be available. sh ls Select the Editor (curly brackets) icon and navigate to the template JSON file. Make a change. For example, change the disk name to az104-disk4 . Use Ctrl +S to save your changes. Note : You can target your template deployment to a resource group, subscription, management group, or tenant. Depending on the scope of the deployment, you use different commands. To deploy to a resource group, use az deployment group create . sh az deployment group create --resource-group az104-rg3 --template-file template.json --parameters parameters.json Ensure the command completes and the ProvisioningState is Succeeded . Confirm the disk was created. sh az disk list --output table Task 5: Deploy a Resource by using Azure Bicep In this task, you will use a Bicep file to deploy a managed disk. Bicep is a declarative automation tool that is built on ARM templates. \u2b07\ufe0f Download the Bicep file for Lab. Continue working in the Cloud Shell in a Bash session. Select Manage files and then Upload the Bicep file to the Cloud Shell. Click Editor and when prompted Confirm the switch to the Classic Cloud Shell. Select the azuredeploydisk.bicep file Take a minute to read through the Bicep template file. Notice how the disk resource is defined. Make the following changes: Change the managedDiskName value, line 2, to Disk4. Change the sku name value, line 26, to StandardSSD_LRS. Change the diskSizeinGiB value; line 7, to 32. Note: A completed Bicep template is available in the lab files. Use Ctrl + S to save your changes. Now, deploy the template. az deployment group create --resource-group az104-rg3 --template-file azuredeploydisk.bicep Confirm the disk was created. sh az disk list --output table Note: You have successfully deployed five managed disks, each in a different way. Nice job! Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. Azure Resource Manager templates let you deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually. An Azure Resource Manager template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that lets you manage your infrastructure declaratively rather than with scripts. Rather than passing parameters as inline values in your template, you can use a separate JSON file that contains the parameter values. Azure Resource Manager templates can be deployed in a variety of ways including the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and CLI. Bicep is an alternative to Azure Resource Manager templates. Bicep uses a declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. Bicep provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse. Bicep offers a first-class authoring experience for your infrastructure-as-code solutions in Azure.

In this lab, you learn the basics of virtual networking and subnetting. You learn how to protect your network with network security groups and application security groups. You also learn about DNS zones and records. This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using East US . Estimated Time: 50 Minutes Lab Scenario Your global organization (i.e. Adamantus Technologies) plans to implement virtual networks. The immediate goal is to accommodate all the existing resources. However, the organization is in a growth phase and wants to ensure there is additional capacity for the growth. The CoreServicesVnet virtual network has the largest number of resources. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network. The ManufacturingVnet virtual network contains systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from. Interactive Lab Simulations There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required. Secure network traffic . Create a virtual machine, a virtual network, and a network security group. Add network security group rules to allow and disallow traffic. Create a simple virtual network . Create a virtual network with two virtual machines. Demonstrate the virtual machines can communicate. Design and implement a virtual network in Azure . Create a resource group and create virtual networks with subnets. Implement virtual networking . Create and configure a virtual network, deploy virtual machines, configure network security groups, and configure Azure DNS. Architecture Diagram These virtual networks and subnets are structured in a way that accommodates existing resources yet allows for the projected growth. Let's create these virtual networks and subnets to lay the foundation for our networking infrastructure. Did you know? : It is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges to reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. Overlapping is a concern across the entire network, whether in the cloud or on-premises. Many organizations design an enterprise-wide IP addressing scheme to avoid overlapping and plan for future growth. Job Skills Task 1: Create a virtual network with subnets using the portal. Task 2: Create a virtual network and subnets using a template. Task 3: Create and configure communication between an Application Security Group and a Network Security Group. Task 4: Configure public and private Azure DNS zones. Task 1: Create a Virtual Network with Subnets using the Portal The organization plans a large amount of growth for core services.

Be sure to select Add for each new subnet. Be sure to delete the default subnet - either before or after creating the other subnets. Subnet Option Value SharedServicesSubnet Subnet name SharedServicesSubnet Starting address 10.20.10.0 Size /24 DatabaseSubnet Subnet name DatabaseSubnet Starting address 10.20.20.0 Size /24 Note: Every virtual network must have at least one subnet. Reminder that five IP addresses will always be reserved, so consider that in your planning. To finish creating the CoreServicesVnet and its associated subnets, select Review + create . Verify your configuration passed validation, and then select Create . Wait for the virtual network to deploy and then select Go to resource . Take a minute to verify the Address space and the Subnets . Notice your other choices in the Settings blade. In the Automation section, select Export template , and then wait for the template to be generated. Download the template. Navigate on the local machine to the Downloads folder and Extract all the files in the downloaded zip file. Before proceeding, ensure you have the template.json file. You will use this template to create the ManufacturingVnet in the next task. Task 2: Create a Virtual Network and Subnets using a Template In this task, you create the ManufacturingVnet virtual network and associated subnets. The organization anticipates growth for the manufacturing offices so the subnets are sized for the expected growth. For this task, you use a template to create the resources. Locate the template.json file exported in the previous task. It should be in your Downloads folder. Edit the file using the editor of your choice. Many editors have a change all occurrences feature. If you are using Visual Studio Code be sure you are working in a trusted window and not in the restricted mode . Consult the architecture diagram to verify the details.

Change all occurrences of DatabaseSubnet to SensorSubnet2 . Change all occurrences of 10.20.20.0/24 to 10.30.21.0/24 . Read back through the file and ensure everything looks correct. Use the architecture diagram for resource names and IP addresses. Be sure to Save your changes. Note: There is a completed template files in the lab files directory. Make changes to the Parameters File Locate the parameters.json file exported in the previous task. It should be in your Downloads folder. Edit the file using the editor of your choice. Replace the one occurrence of CoreServicesVnet with ManufacturingVnet . Save your changes. Deploy the Custom Template In the portal, search for and select Deploy a custom template . Select Build your own template in the editor and then Load file . Select the templates.json file with your Manufacturing changes, then select Save . Select Edit template , and then Load file . Select the parameters.json file with your Manufacturing changes, then select Save . Ensure your resource group, az104-rg4 is selected. Select Review + create and then Create . Wait for the template to deploy, then confirm (in the portal) the Manufacturing virtual network and subnets were created. Note: If you have to deploy more than one time you may find some resources were successfully completed and the deployment is failing. You can manually remove those resources and try again. Task 3: Create and Configure Communication between an Application Security Group and a Network Security Group In this task, we create an Application Security Group and a Network Security Group. The NSG will have an inbound security rule that allows traffic from the ASG. The NSG will also have an outbound rule that denies access to the internet. Create the Application Security Group (ASG) In the Azure portal, search for and select Application security groups . Click Create and provide the basic information. Setting Value Subscription your subscription Resource group az104-rg4 Name asg-web Region East US Click Review + create and then after the validation click Create . Note: At this point, you would associate the ASG with virtual machine(s). These machines will be affected by the inbound NSG rule you create in the next task. Create the Network Security Group and Associate it with CoreServicesVnet In the Azure portal, search for and select Network security groups . Select + Create and provide information on the Basics tab.

When you are finished, select Add . Setting Value Source Any Source port ranges * Destination Service tag Destination service tag Internet Service Custom Destination port ranges 8080 Protocol Any Action Deny Priority 4096 Name DenyAnyCustom8080Outbound Task 4: Configure Public and Private Azure DNS Zones In this task, you will create and configure public and private DNS zones. Configure a Public DNS Zone You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. For example, if you purchased the contoso.xyz domain name from a domain name registrar, you can configure Azure DNS to host the contoso.com domain and resolve www.contoso.xyz to the IP address of your web server or web app. In the portal, search for and select DNS zones . Select + Create . Configure the Basics tab. Property Value Subscription Select your subscription Resource group az-104-rg4 Name contoso.com (if reserved adjust the name) Region East US (review the informational icon) Select Review create and then Create . Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select Go to resource . On the Overview blade notice the names of the four Azure DNS name servers assigned to the zone. Copy one of the name server addresses. You will need it in a future step. Select + Record set . Add a virtual network link record for each virtual network that needs private name-resolution support. Property Value Name www Type A TTL 1 IP address 10.1.1.4 Note: In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the public IP address of your web server. Select OK and verify your domain has an A record set named www . Open a command prompt, and run the following command. If you have changed the domain name, make an adjustment. sh nslookup www.contoso.com <name server name> 1. Verify the host name www.contoso.com resolves to the IP address you provided. This confirms name resolution is working correctly. Configure a Private DNS Zone A private DNS zone provides name resolution services within virtual networks. A private DNS zone is only accessible from the virtual networks that it is linked to and can't be accessed from the internet. In the portal, search for and select Private dns zones . Select + Create . On the Basics tab of Create private DNS zone, enter the information as listed in the table below: Property Value Subscription Select your subscription Resource group az-104-rg4 Name private.contoso.com (adjust if you had to rename) Region East US Select Review create and then Create . Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select Go to resource . Notice on the Overview blade there are no name server records. Select DNS Management and then select Virtual network links . Configure the link. Property Value Link name manufacturing-link Virtual network ManufacturingVnet Select Create and wait for the link to create. From the DNS Management blade select + Recordsets . You would now add a record for each virtual machine that needs private name-resolution support. Property Value Name sensorvm Type A TTL 1 IP address 10.1.1.4 Note: In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the IP address for a specific manufacturing virtual machine. Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. When designing virtual networks it is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges. This will reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic. There are default incoming and outgoing rules which you can customize to your needs. Application security groups are used to protect groups of servers with a common function, such as web servers or database servers. Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution. You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. You can also use private DNS zones to assign DNS names to virtual machines (VMs) in your Azure virtual networks.

Here are the main takeaways for this lab. A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. When designing virtual networks it is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges. This will reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic. There are default incoming and outgoing rules which you can customize to your needs. Application security groups are used to protect groups of servers with a common function, such as web servers or database servers. Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution. You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. You can also use private DNS zones to assign DNS names to virtual machines (VMs) in your Azure virtual networks.

Note : You may need to refresh more than once or open a new browser window in InPrivate mode. Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the key points for this lab. Azure Load Balancer is an excellent choice for distributing network traffic across multiple virtual machines at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP). Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs. An internal (or private) load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. The Basic load balancer is for small-scale applications that don't need high availability or redundancy. The Standard load balancer is for high performance and ultra-low latency. Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. The Application Gateway Standard tier offers all the L7 functionality, including load balancing, The WAF tier adds a firewall to check for malicious traffic. An Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.

Here are the main takeaways for this lab. An Azure storage account contains all your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Azure storage provides several redundancy models including Locally redundant storage (LRS), Zone-redundant storage (ZRS), and Geo-redundant storage (GRS). Azure blob storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured data on Microsoft's data storage platform. Blob stands for Binary Large Object, which includes objects such as images and multimedia files. Azure file Storage provides shared storage for structured data. The data can be organized in folders. Immutable storage provides the capability to store data in a write once, read many (WORM) state. Immutable storage policies can be time-based or legal-hold.

Task 3: Create and configure Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Task 5: Create a virtual machine using Azure PowerShell (optional 1). Task 6: Create a virtual machine using the CLI (optional 2). Azure Virtual Machines Architecture Diagram Task 1: Deploy zone-resilient Azure Virtual Machines by using the Azure Portal In this task, you will deploy two Azure virtual machines into different availability zones by using the Azure portal. Availability zones offer the highest level of uptime SLA for virtual machines at 99.99%. To achieve this SLA, you must deploy at least two virtual machines across different availability zones. Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com . Search for and select Virtual machines , on the Virtual machines blade, click + Create , and then select in the drop-down Azure virtual machine . Notice your other choices. On the Basics tab, in the Availability zone drop down menu, place a checkmark next to Zone 2 . This should select both Zone 1 and Zone 2 . Note : This will deploy two virtual machines in the selected region, one in each zone. You achieve the 99.99% uptime SLA because you have at least two VMs distributed across at least two zones. In the scenario where you might only need one VM, it is a best practice to still deploy the VM to another zone. On the Basics tab, continue completing the configuration: Setting Value Subscription the name of your Azure subscription Resource group az104-rg8 (If necessary, click Create new ) Virtual machine names az104-vm1 and az104-vm2 (After selecting both availability zones, select Edit names under the VM name field.) Region East US Availability options Availability zone Availability zone Zone 1, 2 (read the note about using virtual machine scale sets) Security type Standard Image Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - x64 Gen2 Azure Spot instance unchecked Size Standard D2s v3 Username localadmin Password Provide a secure password Public inbound ports None Would you like to use an existing Windows Server license?

Setting Value Delete public IP and NIC when VM is deleted Checked Load balancing options None Click Next : Management > and specify the following settings (leave others with their default values): Setting Value Patch orchestration options Azure orchestrated Click Next : Monitoring > and specify the following settings (leave others with their default values): Setting Value Boot diagnostics Disable Click Next : Advanced > , take the defaults, then click Review + Create . After the validation, click Create . Note: Notice as the virtual machine deploys the NIC, disk, and public IP address (if configured) are independently created and managed resources. Wait for the deployment to complete, then select Go to resource . Note: Monitor the Notification messages. Task 2: Manage Compute and Storage Scaling for Virtual Machines In this task, you will scale a virtual machine by adjusting its size to a different SKU. Azure provides flexibility in VM size selection so that you can adjust a VM for periods of time if it needs more (or less) compute and memory allocated. This concept is extended to disks, where you can modify the performance of the disk, or increase the allocated capacity. On the az104-vm1 virtual machine, in the Availability + scale blade, select Size . Set the virtual machine size to D2ds_v4 and click Resize . When prompted, confirm the change. Note : Choose another size if D2ds_v4 is not available. Resizing is also known as vertical scaling, up or down. In the Settings area, select Disks . Under Data disks select + Create and attach a new disk . Configure the settings (leave other settings at their default values). Setting Value Disk name vm1-disk1 Storage type Standard HDD Size (GiB) 32 Click Apply . After the disk has been created, click Detach (if necessary, scroll to the right to view the detach icon), and then click Apply . Note : Detaching removes the disk from the VM but keeps it in storage for later use. Search for and select Disks . From the list of disks, select the vm1-disk1 object. Note: The Overview blade also provides performance and usage information for the disk. In the Settings blade, select Size + performance . Set the storage type to Standard SSD , and then click Save . Navigate back to the az104-vm1 virtual machine and select Disks . In the Data disk section, select Attach existing disks . In the Disk name drop-down, select VM1-DISK1 . Verify the disk is now Standard SSD . Select Apply to save your changes. Note: You have now created a virtual machine, scaled the SKU and the data disk size. In the next task we use Virtual Machine Scale Sets to automate the scaling process. Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets Architecture Diagram Task 3: Create and configure Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets In this task, you will deploy an Azure virtual machine scale set across availability zones. VM Scale Sets reduce the administrative overhead of automation by enabling you to configure metrics or conditions that allow the scale set to horizontally scale, scale in or scale out. In the Azure portal, search for and select Virtual machine scale sets and, on the Virtual machine scale sets blade, click + Create . On the Basics tab of the Create a virtual machine scale set blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click Next : Spot > : Setting Value Subscription the name of your Azure subscription Resource group az104-rg8 Virtual machine scale set name vmss1 Region (US)East US Availability zone Zones 1, 2, 3 Orchestration mode Uniform Security type Standard Scaling options Review and take the defaults . We will change this in the next task.

On the Spot tab, accept the defaults and select Next : Disks > . On the Disks tab, accept the default values and click Next : Networking > . On the Networking page, select Edit virtual network link. Make a few changes. When finished, select OK . Setting Value Name vmss-vnet Address range 10.82.0.0/20 (delete the existing address range) Subnet name subnet0 Subnet range 10.82.0.0/24 In the Networking tab, click the Edit network interface icon to the right of the network interface entry. For NIC network security group section, select Advanced and then click Create new under the Configure network security group drop-down list. On the Create network security group blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values): Setting Value Name vmss1-nsg Click Add an inbound rule and add an inbound security rule with the following settings (leave others with their default values): Setting Value Source Any Source port ranges * Destination Any Service HTTP Action Allow Priority 1010 Name allow-http Click Add and, back on the Create network security group blade, click OK . In the Edit network interface blade, in the Public IP address section, click Enabled and click OK . In the Networking tab, under the Load balancing section, specify the following (leave others with their default values). Setting Value Load balancing options Azure load balancer Select a load balancer Create a load balancer On the Create a load balancer page, specify the load balancer name and take the defaults. Click Create when you are done then Next : Management > . Setting Value Load balancer name vmss-lb Note: Pause for a minute and review what you done. At this point, you have configured the virtual machine scale set with disks and networking. In the network configuration you have created a network security group and allowed HTTP. You have also created a load balancer with a public IP address. On the Management tab, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values): Setting Value Boot diagnostics Disable Click Next : Health > . On the Health tab, review the default settings without making any changes and click Next : Advanced > . On the Advanced tab, click Review + create . On the Review + create tab, ensure that the validation passed and click Create . Note : Wait for the virtual machine scale set deployment to complete. This should take approximately 5 minutes. Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets In this task, you scale the virtual machine scale set using a custom scale rule. Select Go to resource or search for and select the vmss1 scale set. Choose Availability + Scale from the left side menu, then choose Scaling . Did you know? You can Manual scale or Custom autoscale . In scale sets with a small number of VM instances, increasing or decreasing the instance count (Manual scale) may be best. In scale sets with a large number of VM instances, scaling based on metrics (Custom autoscale) may be more appropriate. Scale out Rule Select Custom autoscale . Then change the Scale mode to Scale based on metric . And then select Add a rule . Let's create a rule that automatically increases the number of VM instances. This rule scales out when the average CPU load is greater than 70% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is increased by 50%. Setting Value Metric source Current resource (vmss1) Metric namespace Virtual Machine Host Metric name Percentage CPU (review your other choices) Operator Greater than Metric threshold to trigger scale action 70 Duration (minutes) 10 Time grain statistic Average Operation Increase percent by (review other choices) Cool down (minutes) 5 Percentage 50 Be sure to Save your changes. Scale in Rule During evenings or weekends, demand may decrease so it is important to create a scale in rule. Let's create a rule that decreases the number of VM instances in a scale set. The number of instances should decrease when the average CPU load drops below 30% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is decreased by 20%. Select Add a rule , adjust the settings, then select Add . Setting Value Operator Less than Threshold 30 Operation decrease percentage by (review your other choices) Percentage 50 Be sure to Save your changes. Set the instance limits When your autoscale rules are applied, instance limits make sure that you do not scale out beyond the maximum number of instances or scale in beyond the minimum number of instances. Instance limits are shown on the Scaling page after the rules. Setting Value Minimum 2 Maximum 10 Default 2 Be sure to Save your changes On the vmss1 page, select Instances . This is where you would monitor the number of virtual machine instances. Note: If you are interested in using Azure PowerShell for virtual machine creation, try Task 5. If you are interested in using the CLI to create virtual machines, try Task 6. Task 5: Create a Virtual Machine using Azure PowerShell (option 1) Use the icon (top right) to launch a Cloud Shell session. Alternately, navigate directly to https://shell.azure.com . Be sure to select PowerShell . If necessary, configure the shell storage. Run the following command to create a virtual machine. When prompted, provide a username and password for the VM. While you wait check out the New-AzVM command reference for all the parameters associated with creating a virtual machine. powershell New-AzVm ` -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg8' ` -Name 'myPSVM' ` -Location 'East US' ` -Image 'Win2019Datacenter' ` -Zone '1' ` -Size 'Standard_D2s_v3' ` -Credential (Get-Credential) Once the command completes, use Get-AzVM to list the virtual machines in your resource group. powershell Get-AzVM ` -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg8' ` -Status Verify your new virtual machine is listed and the Status is Running . Use Stop-AzVM to deallocate your virtual machine. Type Yes to confirm. powershell Stop-AzVM ` -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg8' ` -Name 'myPSVM' Use Get-AzVM with the -Status parameter to verify the machine is deallocated . Did you know? When you use Azure to stop your virtual machine, the status is deallocated . This means that any non-static public IPs are released, and you stop paying for the VM\u2019s compute costs. Task 6: Create a Virtual Machine using the CLI (option 2) Use the icon (top right) to launch a Cloud Shell session. Alternately, navigate directly to https://shell.azure.com . Be sure to select Bash . If necessary, configure the shell storage. Run the following command to create a virtual machine. When prompted, provide a username and password for the VM. While you wait check out the az vm create command reference for all the parameters associated with creating a virtual machine. sh az vm create --name myCLIVM --resource-group az104-rg8 --image Ubuntu2204 --admin-username localadmin --generate-ssh-keys Once the command completes, use az vm show to verify your machine was created. sh az vm show --name myCLIVM --resource-group az104-rg8 --show-details Verify the powerState is VM Running . Use az vm deallocate to deallocate your virtual machine. Type Yes to confirm. sh az vm deallocate --resource-group az104-rg8 --name myCLIVM Use az vm show to ensure the powerState is VM deallocated . Did you know? When you use Azure to stop your virtual machine, the status is deallocated . This means that any non-static public IPs are released, and you stop paying for the VM\u2019s compute costs. Cleanup your Resources If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select Delete the resource group , Enter resource group name , and then click Delete . Using Azure PowerShell, Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName . Using the CLI, az group delete --name resourceGroupName . Key Takeaways Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. Azure virtual machines are on-demand, scalable computing resources. Azure virtual machines provide both vertical and horizontal scaling options. Configuring Azure virtual machines includes choosing an operating system, size, storage and networking settings. Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The virtual machines in a Virtual Machine Scale Set are created from the same image and configuration. In a Virtual Machine Scale Set the number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.

Task 4: Swap Deployment Slots In this task, you will swap the staging slot with the production slot. Swapping a slot allows you to use the code that you have tested in your staging slot, and move it to production. The Azure portal will also prompt you if you need to move other application settings that you have customized for the slot. Swapping slots is a common task for application teams and application support teams, especially those deploying routine app updates and bug fixes. Navigate back to the Deployment slots blade, and then select Swap . Review the default settings and click Start Swap . Wait for the notification that the swap has finished. Return to the portal home page. You should have both a the production web app and the staging slot.
