## 🔍 Core Concepts Covered in a Cloud Computing Course

An academic course typically explores the following foundational topics:

### 1. **Cloud Deployment Models**

| Model         | Description                                           | Example Use Case                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Public Cloud  | Services delivered over the internet by providers     | Hosting student websites on AWS      |
| Private Cloud | Dedicated cloud infrastructure for one institution    | University-managed internal LMS      |
| Hybrid Cloud  | A mix of public and private cloud solutions           | University data stored locally, website on cloud |

### 2. **Cloud Service Models**

#### A. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  
Provides virtual machines, storage, and networks.  
🖥️ *Example: Hosting a virtual lab environment for student experiments.*

#### B. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**  
Gives students tools to develop, test, and deploy apps.  
🛠️ *Example: Deploying Python/Java apps via Google App Engine.*

#### C. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**  
Delivers ready-to-use software over the web.  
📧 *Example: Using Microsoft 365 for assignments and communication.*
